A simple way to present elements incrementally.

### What Does It Do?

I takes a set of HTMLelements, and iteratively displays them in the order which
they naturally appear in the DOM.

### What Flavors Does It Come In?

Simple! All you need to do is identify a series of elements via a selector. The
Trickle will find those elements' and work it's magic from there.

Advanced! Tricke also allows you to add elements to an existing set, or create
a new set of elements - either in a batch or incrementally - from an exterior
data source.
